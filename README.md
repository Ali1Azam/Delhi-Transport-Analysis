# 🚌 Static Public Transport Analysis of Delhi (GTFS)

This project analyzes the static public transportation data of Delhi using the GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) format. It provides insights into how services operate, stop coverage, route popularity, and time-based patterns — all powered by Python.

## 📁 Dataset Source
- **Format:** GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification)
- **Files used:** `routes.txt`, `trips.txt`, `stop_times.txt`, `stops.txt`, `calendar.txt`
- **Source:** [Delhi Open Transit Data](https://otd.delhi.gov.in/data/static/)

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data overview, structure, and relationships across GTFS files

2. **Summary Statistics**  
   - Descriptive insights for trips, stops, and services

3. **Average Stop Sequence Length per Trip**  
   - Understanding trip length variability

4. **Histogram of Arrival Times**  
   - Identifying peak time patterns

5. **Distribution of Stop Locations**  
   - Geospatial spread of the city’s bus stop network

6. **Route Popularity**  
   - Top 20 most frequently operated bus routes

## 🧠 Learning Experience

This project helped me:
- Work with real-world public transit data formats
- Use Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data manipulation and visualization
- Clean and preprocess large, messy datasets effectively
- Visualize route-level and trip-level patterns to understand urban mobility
- Strengthen my understanding of public infrastructure data
